## 🤝 Collaborate

We’re selective and question-driven. We say yes when a project has clear public-health relevance or impact.

**What gets us excited**
- Disease ecology we know, in *new or marginalized* settings  
- Humanitarian health with partners building research capacity  
- Climate–infectious disease linkages  
- Community-based interventions & access to care in neglected populations  
- Thoughtful dynamics of human/vector movement; activity spaces; linking EO to people and places  

**How we work**
- Mostly international; growing U.S. portfolio  
- Open science when safe; protect sensitive data  
- Rigorous, plain-language analytics—jargon-light, map-friendly, mixed methods welcome  

**Helpful context in your note (optional)**
- The question and the **so what?**  
- Who/where (population, partners) and what data exist  
- What you hope our group adds + rough timeline  
- Links to any prior or related work
